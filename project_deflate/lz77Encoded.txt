Chapter    It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife  However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters  My dear Mr Bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last  (92,10,r)eplied(203,9,h)ad not  But it is returned she for Mrs Long has just been here and she told me all about it  (212,10,m)ade no answer  Do you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently  You want to tell me and I have no objection to hearing it  This was invitation enough  Why my dear you must know Mrs Long says(380,18,i)s taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it(711,9,a)greed with Mr Morris immediately(753,12,t)o take (999,11,b)efore Michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week  What is his name  Bingley  Is he married or single  Oh Single my dear to be sure A(39,8,m)(400,21,o)ur or five thousand a year What a fine thing for our girls  How so How can it affect them  (993,18,r)eplied his wife how can you be so tiresome Y(641,13,t)hat I am thinking of his marrying one of them  Is that his design in settling here  Design Nonsens(142,14,t)alk so But it is very likel(544,10,m)ay fall in love with o(138,11,a)nd therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes  I see no occasion for that You and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any(356,9,M)r Bingley may like you the best of the party(526,10,y)ou flatter me I certainly have had my share of beauty but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now When a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over (620,13,e)r own beauty  In such cases a (100,10,n)ot often much beauty to think of  But m(273,11,m)ust indeed go and see M(355,10,w)hen he comes into the neighbourhood  It is more than I engage for I assure you  But consider your(271,11,O)nly think what an establishment it would be for o(892,11,S)ir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers Indeed you must go for it(744,9,i)mpossible for us to v(905,9,i)f you do not  You are overscrupulous surely I dare say M(421,11,i)ll be very glad to see you and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy  I desire you will do no such thing Lizzy is not a bit better than the others and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane nor(29,9,g)oodhumoured as Lydia But you are always giving her the preference  They have non(686,10,m)uch to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters  Mr Bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way You take delight in vexing me You have no compassion for my poor nerves  You mistake me my dear I have a high respect for your nerves They are my old friends I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least  Ah y(946,10,k)now what I suffer  But I hop(710,11,g)et over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood  It will be no use to us if twenty such should come sinc(872,11,n)ot visit them  Depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty I will v(69,10,a)ll  (606,10,w)as so odd a mixtu(668,11, )parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandt(442,12,h)ad been insufficient to make his wife understand his character Her mind was less difficult to develop She was a woman of mean (88,10,i)ng little information and uncertain temper When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous The business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news    Chapter  (467,16,a)mong the earliest of those who waited on Mr Bingley He had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it It was then disclosed in the following manner Observing his second(374,9, )employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with  I hope(328,12,w)ill like it Lizzy  We are not in a way to know what M(392,10,l)ikes said her mother resentfully since we(84,9,t)o visit  But you forget mamma said Elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that Mrs Long promised to introduce him  I do not believe (53,9,w)ill do any such thing She has two niece(802,9,o)wn She is a selfish hypocritical woman and I have no opinion of her  No more have I said M(807,9,a)nd I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you  Mrs Bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters  Dont keep coughing so Kitty for Heavens sake Have a little compassion on my nerves You tear them to pieces  Kitty has no discretion in her coughs(671,10,f)ather she times them ill  (530,9,c)ough for my own amusement replied Kitty fretfully When is your next ball to be Lizzy  Tomorrow fortnight  Aye so it is cried h(837,10,a)nd Mrs Long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her t(779,16,f)or she will not know him herself  Then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and i(887,9,M)r Bingley to her  I(159,10,M)(747,9,i)(180,10,w)hen I am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing  I honour your circumspection A(397,10,s)(96,9,a)nce is certainly very little One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a f(499,9,B)ut if we do not venture somebody else will and after all Mrs Long and h(882,13,m)ust stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office I will take it on myself  The girls stared at their father Mrs Bennet said only Nonsense n(9,8, )What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he Do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense I cannot quite agree with you there What say you Mary For you are a young lady of deep reflection I know and read great books and make extracts  Mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how  While Mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to M(967,10, )I am sick of M(992,10,c)ried his wife(40,8,o)rry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before If I had known as much this morning I(944,11,w)ould not have called on him It is very unlucky but as I have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of Mrs Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while  How good(53,8,i)n you my dear Mr Bennet But I knew I should persuade you at last I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an ac(377,11,W)ell how pleased I am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone(601,14,a)nd never said a word about it till now  Now Kitty you may cough as much as you choose said M(308,9,a)nd as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of h(876,9,W)hat an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter At our time of life it is not so pleasant I can tell you to be making new a(897,11,s) every day but for your sakes we would do anything Lydia my love though you are the youngest I dare say Mr Bingley will dance with you at the next ball  Oh said Lydia stoutly I am not afraid for though I am t(127,13,m) the tallest  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return (955,9,s) visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner    Chapter    Not all that Mrs Bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of M(460,10,T)hey attacked him in various wayswith barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas Her report was highly favourable Sir William had been delighted with him He was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party Nothing could be more delightful To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes(581,14,s) heart were entertained  If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield said M(848,10,t)o h(748,13,d) all the others equally well married I shall have nothing to wish for  In a few days M(804,10,r)eturned Mr Bennets visit and sat about ten minutes(556,10,i)n his library He had e(294,11,h)opes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father The ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had M(560,10,p)lanned the courses that were to do credit(603,9,o)usekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all M(565,10,w)as obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their i(296,10,e)tc (803,11,w)as quite disconcerted She could not imagine what business he could have in town so s(381,9, )his arrival in Hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that M(553,14,t)o bring twelv(923,9,a)nd seven gentlemen with him to the assembly The girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only six(169,10,f)rom Londonhis five sisters and a cousin And when the party entered t(234,12,r)oom it consisted of only five altogetherM(911,10,h)is two(121,9,t)he husband of the eldest and another young man  (987,15,g)oodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners His sisters were fine wo(507,9,a)n air of decided fashion His brotherinlaw Mr Hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than(989,12,a)nd he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable coun(833,12,b)eing unworthy to be compared with h(727,10, )(959,11,h)ad soon made himself acquaint(61,8,a)ll the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves What a contrast between him and hi(315,9,M)r Darcy danced only once with Mrs Hurst and onc(24,8,i)ss(775,9,d)eclined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of t(783,11,i)n walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party His character was decided He was the proudest most d(659,12,m)an in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs Bennet whose dislik(221,9,g)eneral behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time Mr Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation b(749,15,M)r Bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press h(811,10,t)o join it  Come Darcy said he I must have you dance I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner You had much better dance  I certainly shall not You know how I detest it unless I am(551,11,l)y acquainted with my partner At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable Your sisters are engaged and there is not another wo(881,11,r)oom whom i(99,8,n)ot be a punishment to me to stand up with  I w(52,12,s)o fastidious as you are cried(545,12,f)or a kingdom Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty  You are dancing with the only handsome girl (331,12,s)aid Mr Darcy looking at the eldest Miss Bennet  Oh She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and I dare say very agreeable Do let me ask(689,12,t)o introduce you  Which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said She is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men You had better return to your(334,9,a)nd enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me  (857,13,l)lowed his advice(656,10,w)alked off and E(369,9,r)emained with no very cordial feelings toward him She told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family Mrs Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party(402,12,h)ad danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way E(881,9,f)elt Janes pleasure Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and Catherine and Lydia (274,9,f)ortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants They found Mr Bennet still up With a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations He had rather hoped that his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear  Oh my dear M(342,9,a)s she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball I wish you (979,9,t)here Jane was so admired nothing could be like it Everybody said how well she looked and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice Only think of that my dear he actually(61,23,a)nd she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time First of all h(36,8,M)iss Lucas I was so vexed to see him stand up with her But however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance So he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next Then(18,9,t)hird he d(466,11,M)iss King and the two fourth with Maria Lucas a(36,12,i)fth with Jane again(70,13,s)ix(69,8,L)izzy(99,9,B)oulanger  If he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much For Gods sake say no more of his partners Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance  Oh my dear I am quite delighted with him He is so excessively handsome And his sisters are charming women I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses I dare say the lace upon Mrs Hursts gown  Here she was interrupted again Mr Bennet protested against any description of finery She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and rela(341,9,m)uch bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of Mr Darcy  But I can assure you she added that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him He walked here and h(19,9,t)here fancying himself so very great Not handsome enough to dance with I wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns I quite detest the man
